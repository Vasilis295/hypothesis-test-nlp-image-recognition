# hypothesis-test-nlp-image-recognition

###first simple projects in hypothesis testing, nlp and image recognition

Hypothesis testing dataset is the wine dataset we used in many of our notebooks(projects) already like classification and clustering1.
NLP dataset is a Kaggle dataset:https://www.kaggle.com/code/harshsinha1234/email-spam-classification-nlp/data
Image recognition dataset is a keras incorporated dataset.

Nlp classification is basic, as with a few transformations(cleaning) of the dataset the score went to 0.99 (accuracy but not only), however it shows knowledge to apply techniques for nlp classfication and basic cleaning

Image recognition also is basic, as it is a widely used dataset, however, we experimented with different keras models to increase our train and test scores which went close to 1.

Hypothesis testing notebook has t tests for variables and the question if they are significant or not. p values lower than 0.05 or 0.025 depending if this is a one sided or two sided test
mean the variable is significant. We complemented our analysis with some scatterplots. It was no surprise that the clearer the pattern in the scatterplot, the more significant the variable was at the test.
